Overview:

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from a credit card dataset using Machine Learning techniques. It is designed to help financial institutions detect suspicious activity and minimize financial losses.

Dataset
Source: The dataset used is based on transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

Features:
1. It contains only numerical input variables.
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to transform features for confidentiality.
3. There are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration and Visualization
2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
3. Handling Class Imbalance
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation

Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Scikit-learn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Jupyter Notebook

How to Run:-

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Aaddrriikkaa15/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook creditcardfrauddetection.ipynb


Results:
Achieved high precision and recall on detecting fraudulent transactions.
Successfully handled class imbalance through sampling techniques.

Future Improvements
Explore deep learning models like Autoencoders.

Deployment of the model as a real-time fraud detection system.
